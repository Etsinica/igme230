                <p class="big"> Hey, it is Aaron! Guess what… He plays volleyball! Ya, pretty crazy, I know, right? Well, yes, volleyball… He currently plays on the Lockport Volleyball club team. He’s been playing on that team since he was 13 (currently 15… 6’3… and still growing). He also played on the Clarence High School Junior Varsity team for two years. Just last season he got called up to the Varsity team to play in tournaments and the Section VI Western New York Playoffs. Winning the Section VI title is one of Aaron’s crowning achievements as a volleyball player thus far. He also considers making the modified volleyball team back in eighth grade as a crowning achievement; he felt like part of the team. Before he wanted to join the modified team he got inspired to play volleyball by watching it on the Olympics.

                <p class="small"> He has traveled to various tournament locations through the Lockport club team. He’s been throughout Western New York for local tournaments, Harrisburg Pennsylvania for the North East Championships, and Dallas for the National Competition. This year he will be going to Columbus Ohio with the Lockport team for the National Competition.

                <p class="small"> So as of now his typical rolls are middle, outside hitter, and right side hitter with outside hitter being his favourite position. He has specialized in these positions throughout his volleyball career and plans on strengthening them over the next few years. Aaron plans to eventually play volleyball in college though he doesn’t currently have any particular school in his sights.
